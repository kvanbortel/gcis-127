Unit 01 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
==============================================================================

0. Create a new package under unit07 named "practicum" and implement your 
   solution to the remaining problems in that package.


1. Create a new Java class named "Practice01" and define a static function 
   named "arrayToString" that declares a parameter for an int array and returns
   a String. Your function should translate the array into a string in the 
   format "[1, 2, 3]" (do not use the Arrays.toString() method to do it for 
   you).


2. Create a new enum to represent Pokémon types. You may add as many types as 
   you want to, but at a minimum, you will need types for grass, fire, and 
   water.


3. Create a new class to represent a Pokémon that meets the following 
   requirements. 
   a. Every Pokémon has a name, type, and level.
   b. A Pokémon may be created with a name, type, and level or with just a name
      and a type, in which case the default level should be 1.
   c. A Pokémon's name should be accessible from outside of the class. A 
      Pokémon trainer may choose to change the Pokémon's name at any time.
   d. A Pokémon's type should be accessible from outside of the class. The 
      Pokémon's type can never change.
   e. A Pokémon's level should be accessible from outside the class. The level 
      cannot be directly modified, but the Pokémon can level up one level at a
      time to a max level of 100.
   f. The Pokémon should have a String representation in the format 
      "Pokemon{name=<name>, type=<type>, level=<level>}".
   g. Two Pokémon are considered equal if they have the same type and level. 
      The name does not matter.
