Unit 10 Mini-Practicum

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in the practicum folder.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 

================================================================================

A mother vertex is a vertex in a graph from which all other vertices can be 
reached by at least one path. There may be more than one mother vertex in a 
graph! The mothers.png file contains two graphs along with their corresponding 
mother vertices. You will need to use the AdjacencyGraph class in the 
"unit11.graphs" package.

Create a new Java class in a file called "Mothers.java" in the practicum package
and define a static method named "findMothers" that declares parameters for an 
unweighted graph of strings and a complete list of the values in the graph. It 
should return a List of values. Hint: you can use Arrays.asList(...) to create 
an unmodifiable list from any number of parameters, e.g. Arrays.asList("a", "b",
"c") will create a list containing the values "a", "b", and "c".

1. Implement an algorithm for finding mother vertices in the graph using the 
   list of values passed in as a parameter.

2. Return a list of the values of all mother vertices in the graph.

3. Define a main method with the appropriate signature and test your algorithm 
   with at least the two graphs pictured in the image file graphs.png.
