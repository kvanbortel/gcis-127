a.
Increasing the time that the dropper waits makes it take longer for the goats to eat turnips. Decreasing the time to 0
makes the game run almost instantly. This is because when it is waiting it is not dropping turnips for goats to eat.

b.
The more turnips are dropped at once, the faster the game completes. This is because there is less waiting between
turnip dropper drops since there are less of them overall.
