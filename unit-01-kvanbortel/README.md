Hello!

Welcome to Software Development for Transfers, an introductory programming 
course with an emphasis on software engineering, incremental development, and 
testing.

If you are reading this, then you have accepted the invitation to your very 
first homework unit. Congratulations!

As long as you are practicing the Git Workflow, there is nothing to submit. 
Your graders will check your repository on GitHub to make sure that you 
completed your work before the deadline. It is very often the case that you 
will continue to build on your solutions to class activities in a homework 
assignment and vice versa. For this reason it is important that you complete 
your activities before the deadline, which is the end of class for class 
activities and usually the beginning of the next class for homework. Extensions
will not be granted for late homework assignments.

The good news is that, provided that you practice good habits, all of your work
will be backed up on GitHub's servers, so you don't need to worry about the 
proverbial dog eating your homework (or your laptop breaking, losing your 
external SSD, etc.).

If you have any questions, please contact your instructor!

Good luck and have a great semester!
