The empty directory did not appear in GitHub

There is one copy of questions.txt in the "Kayla" directory on GitHub, which is now present. There is another copy of it outside of this directory from when I pushed it the first time. This is because the file was only moved on my machine locally and I would have to use the Git workflow to change that in GitHub.
