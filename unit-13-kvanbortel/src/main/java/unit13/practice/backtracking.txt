13.29 - Backtracking II
Configuration:
Fields:
- list of packed boxes with pack location (top-left corner)
- list of unpacked boxes

Successor:
- Create one configuration for each unpacked box, packing it into the next available spot to the left. If there is no spot
to the left, try placing it above.

Pruning strategy:
- If the configuration has a total height > 3 or a total width > 7, it is invalid

Goal:
- The unpacked list is empty
